## 🚀 About the Challenge - Commercializing Low Earth Orbit (LEO)

As the commercialization of space rapidly accelerates, the future of business in low Earth orbit (LEO) holds incredible potential, but also presents significant operational, regulatory, and environmental challenges. This new economic frontier invites innovative and sustainable approaches to foster long-term viability and responsible execution. Your challenge is to conceptualize and design a scalable, sustainable, business model, accompanied by a prototype, that explores the unique opportunities LEO offers while addressing the complexities of operating in space.
